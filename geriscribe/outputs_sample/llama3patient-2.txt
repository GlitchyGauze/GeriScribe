**COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT**

* **Mobility**: Uses wheelchair and not interested in PT, history of multiple falls resulting in hospitalizations
* **Medications**: On tramadol, multiple refills from multiple prescribers, advised to establish care with pain clinic
* **Mind**:
\t+ Geriatric Depression Scale: Normal
\t+ SLUMS Test: Normal
* **Multicomplexity**: Multiple medications, multiple prescribers, and lack of coordination may be contributing to patient's poor pain control.

**ASSESSMENT AND PLAN**

* Patient's chronic hip pain is not well-controlled due to polypharmacy and lack of coordination among prescribers.
* I recommend discontinuing tramadol due to the risk of serotonin syndrome with SSRI use.
* The patient should establish care with a pain clinic for better pain management and coordination of medications.
* At this time, I will not refill tramadol or other medications until the patient is established in a pain clinic."}
