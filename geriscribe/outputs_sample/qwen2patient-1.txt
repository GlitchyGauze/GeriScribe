Multicomplexity: Treatment challenges include managing the patient\u2019s diabetes, understanding if the headache is related to her fall or other health issues, and ensuring she receives adequate pain management while avoiding complications from polypharmacy.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The assessment reveals concerns about potential intracranial pathology associated with the recent onset of headache following a fall. The plan recommends that Alice be directed to an Emergency Department (ED) for thorough examination and necessary diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies, to rule out any underlying neurological issue.

In summary, her immediate priority is ED referral due to concern for possible intracranial pathology related to the new headache and history of falls. She will receive medical attention in a clinical setting equipped with appropriate diagnostic resources.
