**Patient Name:** Bob Smith

**Date of Birth:** ***NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED***

**Chief Complaint:** Claudication due to peripheral artery disease

**History of Presenting Illness:** Patient has been experiencing worsening claudication despite treatment. Recent Doppler study shows a worsening ankle-brachial index (ABI) prompting the need for further evaluation and management.

**Surgical History:** None reported

**Social History:**

**Family History:** ***NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED***

**COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT:**

**Matters Most:** Family is what matters most to the patient.

**Mobility:** No recent falls reported. Worsening claudication may impact mobility in the future.

**Medications:** Patient has polypharmacy.

**Mind:**

**Multicomplexity:** Summary of what makes treatment of patient challenging: complex medical history, including CAD and peripheral artery disease, as well as a history of lung cancer. The patient's polypharmacy and risk of falls due to worsening claudication also present challenges.
