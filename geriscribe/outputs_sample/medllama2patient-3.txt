He also has chronic claudication which may affect his quality of life. His polypharmacy is concerning as well. We should continue to monitor his blood pressure regularly and consider adding a diuretic if needed for fluid management. We will also ensure that he is adherent to his medications and encourage smoking cessation. Referral to cardiology is appropriate given the presence of CAD, and we may consider referral to psychiatry for ongoing monitoring of depression. (Dr. O'Sullivan)

This patient presents with a complex multi-morbid profile including CAD, PAD, smoking and history of lung cancer. The presence of chronic claudication also highlights the importance of considering frailty in our assessment.

Given the presence of depression, a psychiatric evaluation would be beneficial in identifying potential contributing factors. (Dr. McLoughlin)
