The patient also has chronic hip pain, osteoarthritis, multiple falls with hospitalizations, and requires medication refills, especially since he's on an SSRI. We reviewed his Medication Use Review Program Report, which shows multiple prescribers. We advise him to establish care with a pain clinic for better pain control. He denies any interest in physical therapy but is wheelchair-bound. The Assistant should inform the doctor once the results of the GDS and SLUMS are available."}
