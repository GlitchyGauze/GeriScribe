COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRICS ASSESSMENT

MATTERS MOST: Family is of utmost importance to this patient.

MEDICATIONS: The patient is on cilastazol for claudication management and will be adding medications in consultation with Dr. Steppenwolf as part of his follow-up plan. He has polypharmacy, which needs to be reviewed and optimized.

MIND: GDS score is 8/15, indicating mild depression. Further assessment and potential referral to psychiatry for SSRI treatment are warranted due to refractory symptoms.

MOBILITY: The patient reports no recent falls but has worsening ABI as indicated by Doppler studies. He uses walking aids or assistive devices for mobility support.

MULTICOMPLEXITY: The patient has CAD, PAD, a history of lung cancer, and is on multiple medications. His socioeconomic challenges (living with wife and children) also impact his care. Regular follow-ups with Dr. Steppenwolf and review of his complex medical regimen are essential.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'llama3.2', 'created_at': '2025-05-06T00:33:37.441517Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 11867869042, 'load_duration': 24251792, 'prompt_eval_count': 527, 'prompt_eval_duration': 407917042, 'eval_count': 508, 'eval_duration': 11432004167, 'message': Message(role='assistant', content='', images=None, tool_calls=None)} id='run--aa3ccf53-1b9d-4a1b-8846-e2ba39193241-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 527, 'output_tokens': 508, 'total_tokens': 1035}
