MEDICATIONS: Levadopa carbidopa continues for mixed dementia. New onset heartburn to be managed with trial of PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) medication.

MIND: Clarice scores 10/15 on the GDS, indicating mild depression. SLUMS was poor, but no acute changes suggest no delirium at this time. Further assessment of cognitive function is needed to monitor for progression or worsening.

MOBILITY: Clarice has experienced multiple falls within the last year, which may indicate a need for further assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. She uses assistive devices for walking (not specified). The patient continues to smoke, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and exacerbates COPD symptoms.
